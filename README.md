# airbrakes-flight

Run

```bash
bash speedystart.sh
```

to instantly start the project. You might have to stop any `cpss-ros2`
containers running on your machine via `docker stop cpss-ros2` before if you've
run the script before.

Your current directory is mounted in `/home/pwd` in the container.

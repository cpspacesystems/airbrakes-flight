## Quickstart
> If you're on a Mac, follow the steps under "Step-by-Step Guide" on [this page](https://gist.github.com/sorny/969fe55d85c9b0035b0109a31cbcb088) first.

Run

```bash
bash speedystart.sh
```

to instantly start the project. You might have to stop any `cpss-ros2`
containers running on your machine via `docker stop cpss-ros2` if you've
run the script before. You'll be dropped into a `tmux` session.

> It might take a hot second to run; it's building a whole Docker image.

Your current directory is mounted in `/home/pwd` in the container. Edits made in
the container will be reflected in real time on your host machine and vice versa--so the ideal workflow is to develop on your host machine using your favorite IDE, then run the changes in the ROS2 container that the script launches. You don't have to open/close any windows or refresh anything; the mounted directory just updates.

Look up how to use `tmux`; it's how you'll open different terminal windows at
the same time (as ROS2 frequently requires). In particular, learn how to create
panes, which split one terminal window into two. Windows might also be useful for creating "browser tab"-like setups. 

## Docker Setup
You'll need Docker for this. [Here's a setup tutorial](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).  


## MICRO-ROS Setup
-  Install PlatformIO extension for VSCode
	- if you get the error "no Python3" or related, run the following in the terminal and restart vscode:
	- sudo apt install python3-venv
- Clone the repo and Open the micro-ros-demo-project
- Plug in the teensy 
- Build the project, upload the project

- Install micro-ros agent
 	- NOTE: If you run into an error saying "/dev/ttyACM0 permission denied" or similar, enter the following command:
	- sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
- start the micro-ros agent
- Unplug and re-plug in your pico. If you see flashing, it works!
